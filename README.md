# Spacemacs
https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs

# Installation
```
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus
$ brew linkapps emacs-plus
```

Or if you prefer to run spacemacs in terminal like me, just install 
```brew install emacs```


```
$ git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

# Configuration

```
$ git clone [repo] to ~
$ ln -s ./spacemacs/spacemacs ./.spacemacs
```

and install fonts

```
https://github.com/powerline/fonts
```

I like `Inconsolata-g`
Change fonts in Terminal preferences

# Run

```
$ emacs
```

That's it. Simple and enjoy it.
